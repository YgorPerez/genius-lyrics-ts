# genius-lyrics-ts

Get lyrics from google with Typescript, Javascript, or Node

## Got the idea and part of the code from [genius-lyrics-api](https://github.com/farshed/genius-lyrics-api)

### Differences

- Has a single method, `getLyrics`
- Written in typescript
- Uses node-parser for better performance instead of cheerio
- Edge runtime compatible
