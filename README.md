Get lyrics from genius-api with Typescript, Javascript, or Node

## Got the idea and part of the code from [genius-lyrics-api](https://github.com/farshed/genius-lyrics-api)

### Differences

- Wrriten in typescript
- Uses node-parsr for better performance intead of cheerio
- Edge runtime compatible because it uses the native fetch
